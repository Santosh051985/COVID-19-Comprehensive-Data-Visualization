Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) Pandemic


Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
I did my best to follow a comprehensive, but not exhaustive, analysis of the data. I'm far from reporting a rigorous study in this kernel, but I hope that it can be useful for the community, so I'm sharing how I applied some of those data analysis principles to this problem. I will also be doing visualizations using plotly, matplotlib and seaborn from which we are gonna get valuable insights.
The main purpose of creating this notebook is to visualize the pandemic covid-19 and it's effects. It can be used by resource persons to get valuables insights and to build upon it.

What we are doing in this Notebook  is:
1) Basic exploratory data analysis
2) Univariable study: We'll just focus on the dependent variables i.e. ('Confirmed' ,'Deaths','Active') and try to know a little bit more about it.
